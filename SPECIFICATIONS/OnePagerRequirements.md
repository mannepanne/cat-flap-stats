## 🎯 Project Vision

**Transform cat flap usage data into meaningful behavioral insights.** We're building a comprehensive analytics platform that liberates data trapped in weekly PDF reports and creates scientifically grounded visualizations of Sven's outdoor activity patterns, seasonal behaviors, and health indicators.

### Ultimate Goal
Enable deep understanding of pet behavioral patterns through:
- **Chronobiological analysis** - Natural activity rhythms and "Peak Sven Hours"
- **Seasonal pattern detection** - Understanding long-term behavioral changes
- **Health monitoring** - Early detection of behavioral anomalies
- **Contextual insights** - Correlating behavior with environmental events

### Target Audience
Magnus and Wendy - personal tool for understanding Sven's behavior patterns and well-being.

**🎯 Step 4: Seasonal Pattern Detection (NEXT PRIORITY)**
*Estimated Duration: 1.5 weeks*

**Core Hypotheses to Test:**
- Sven stays outdoors for longer durations during summer months
- Activity frequency varies significantly between seasons (more indoor time in winter)
- Activity timing shifts correlate with seasonal daylight changes

**Data Analysis Framework:**
- **Season Definition**: UK South meteorological seasons (Spring: Mar-May, Summer: Jun-Aug, Autumn: Sep-Nov, Winter: Dec-Feb)
- **Statistical Testing**: p-value < 0.05 for significance (configurable)
- **Data Requirements**: 30 days minimum (with warnings), 60+ days preferred, 75+ days ideal
- **Available Data**: ~505 days covering 5 complete seasons + 2 partial seasons

**Backend Implementation:**
- Add seasonal categorization to analytics pipeline (`compute_analytics.py`)
- Calculate frequency and duration statistics per season
- Statistical significance testing framework for seasonal comparisons
- Season completeness scoring and confidence indicators
- Integration with existing precomputed analytics structure

**Frontend Implementation (/seasonal route):**
- New `/seasonal` page with dashboard-consistent styling
- Navigation integration across all pages (Dashboard/Patterns/Circadian/Seasonal/Annotations)
- **Priority Visualizations:**
  1. **Seasonal Heatmap**: Activity frequency and duration by month/week with clear seasonal boundaries
  2. **Overlay Actogram**: Multiple seasons displayed on same timeline for direct comparison
- **Statistics Summary**: Frequency and duration averages per season with significance indicators
- **Data Quality Indicators**: Clear labeling of partial vs complete seasons
- **Annotation Integration**: All annotation markers on timeline-based visualizations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout following established patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- Visual confirmation of duration hypothesis (longer summer outdoor sessions)
- Statistical validation of seasonal frequency differences
- Clear identification of partial season data limitations
- Professional presentation with scientific rigor
- Seamless integration with existing annotation system

**Future Enhancement Pipeline:**
- **Step 4.2**: Timing analysis (dawn/dusk activity shifts with seasonal daylight)
- **Step 4.3**: Year-over-year seasonal comparison (2024 vs 2025 patterns)
- **Step 4.4**: Weather API integration for environmental correlation
- **Step 4.5**: Interactive drill-down functionality and custom date ranges
- **Step 4.6**: Advanced visualizations (polar charts, box plots, trend analysis)

### Phase 2.3: Advanced Health Monitoring (Priority 3)
**Target User Stories:** US-017, US-018

**Step 5: Anomaly Detection System**
- Statistical anomaly detection using ±2 standard deviation thresholds
- Classification of mild/moderate/significant anomalies
- Sustained pattern disruption alerts (>3 days deviation)
- Change point detection algorithm implementation
- *Estimated Duration: 2 weeks*

**Step 6: Data Quality Dashboard**
