## üéØ Project Vision

**Transform cat flap usage data into meaningful behavioral insights.** We're building a comprehensive analytics platform that liberates data trapped in weekly PDF reports and creates scientifically grounded visualizations of Sven's outdoor activity patterns, seasonal behaviors, and health indicators.

### Ultimate Goal
Enable deep understanding of pet behavioral patterns through:
- **Chronobiological analysis** - Natural activity rhythms and "Peak Sven Hours"
- **Seasonal pattern detection** - Understanding long-term behavioral changes
- **Health monitoring** - Early detection of behavioral anomalies
- **Contextual insights** - Correlating behavior with environmental events

### Target Audience
Magnus and Wendy - personal tool for understanding Sven's behavior patterns and well-being.

- No way to analyze trends over full date range
- Inability to identify seasonal or behavioral patterns
- Data stored in unusable format for analysis

### Our Solution
A comprehensive data processing and analytics platform that:
1. **Extracts** individual session data from SURE Petcare PDF reports
2. **Processes** data with mathematical precision (100% validation accuracy)
3. **Analyzes** behavioral patterns using chronobiology research standards
4. **Visualizes** insights through scientifically accurate dashboards

### Technology Foundation
- **Backend:** Python-based extraction engine with comprehensive testing
