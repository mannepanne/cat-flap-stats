## Executive summary
A Python-based data extraction tool that scrapes cat flap usage statistics from SURE Petcare PDF reports, processes and concatenates the data for analysis, enabling personal insights into pet behavior patterns and seasonal trends. The tool will transform weekly PDF reports into consolidated downloadable datasets which will be used to present comprehensive historical analysis of Sven's behavior patterns including seasonal and routine changes.

## Description: What is this about?
Creating a personal data processing pipeline to extract cat flap usage data from weekly PDF reports, transform it into analyzable format, and enable comprehensive historical analysis of Sven's behavior patterns including seasonal and routine changes. The project focuses on liberating data trapped in individual PDF files and making it accessible for trend analysis and pattern discovery.

## Problem: What problem is this addressing?
Pet owners cannot effectively analyze long-term cat flap usage patterns due to data being trapped in individual PDF files with no aggregation capabilities.

**Pain points:**
- Weekly manual PDF downloads with data scattered across 50+ files
- No way to analyze trends over full date range
- Inability to identify seasonal or behavioral patterns
- Inherent data gaps from alternative entry/exit methods
- Data stored in unusable format for analysis

**Problem statement:**
I am Sven's human. I am trying to understand and analyze my cat's outdoor activity patterns over time. But I cannot access meaningful analytics because the SURE Petcare app only provides weekly PDF exports with no aggregation or analysis tools, which makes me feel frustrated that we have all this data but can't make good use of it.

## Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Personal frustration with valuable data being inaccessible for analysis, desire to understand seasonal patterns and routine changes in pet behavior, year's worth of data represents significant investment in data collection that's currently unusable. The consistent weekly data collection over approximately one year demonstrates commitment to tracking, but the current format prevents any meaningful longitudinal analysis.

## Audience: Who are we building for?
Magnus and Wendy as primary personal users, not intended for broader distribution or commercial use. This is a personal tool to solve a specific household data analysis need.

## Success: What does the ideal outcome look like?
A consolidated dataset spanning the full date range that can be downloaded from the Cat Flap Stats website and if so desired imported into PowerBI, Tableau, or other analysis tools for pattern discovery and visualisation, enabling month-on-month and season-on-season comparisons. Once the dataset is available, in following phases visualisations and analysis will be presented in the Cat Flap Stats website.

**Goals:**
- Phase 1: Reliable PDF data extraction and concatenation into analyzable format with proper handling of data gaps
- Phase 2: Explore dashboard options for seasonal and routine pattern analysis

**Non goals / not in scope:**
- Custom dashboard development in initial phase
- Distribution to other users
- Perfect data completeness (gaps are expected and acceptable)
- Alternative data entry methods

## Key metrics: How do we know we achieved the outcome?
Successful extraction validated against 'golden weeks' with known exact data, expectation of at least one entry/exit per day in winter months (with some exceptions), higher accuracy expected in winter data vs summer data due to reduced back door usage.

**User metrics:**
- Data completeness rate
- Successful PDF processing rate
- Validation accuracy against golden weeks

**Business metrics:**
Not applicable - personal tool

**Technical metrics:**
- PDF parsing success rate
- Data extraction accuracy
- Processing time per PDF file

## Risks: What can go wrong? What are the potential mitigations?
**What can go wrong:**
- PDF format changes from SURE Petcare
- Corrupt data in PDF files
- PDF parsing failures
- Data extraction errors across different PDF variations

**Mitigations:**
- Build flexible parsing script to handle format variations
- Implement data corruption detection and warnings
