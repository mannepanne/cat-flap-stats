# Scientific Analytics Approach for Cat Flap Behavioral Analysis

**Document Created:** June 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Establish scientifically robust methodologies for analyzing Sven's behavioral patterns  
**Based on:** Chronobiology, animal behavior research, and time series analysis literature

## Overview

This document outlines the scientific approach for analyzing cat flap usage data to identify behavioral patterns, detect anomalies, and track changes over time. Our methodology is grounded in established chronobiological research and animal behavior analysis techniques.

## Research Foundation

### Chronobiology Research Standards

**Minimum Data Requirements:**
- **Duration**: 2 weeks minimum for reliable rhythm detection, 4+ weeks preferred
- **Analysis Windows**: Rolling 7-day periods for ongoing pattern assessment
- **Sample Size**: Individual longitudinal studies require extensive temporal data (we have 505+ days ✅)
- **Recording Frequency**: Continuous monitoring preferred (our dataset provides session-level granularity ✅)

**Statistical Approaches:**
- **Circular Statistics**: Essential for time-of-day analysis (exit/entry times are circular data)
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Measure behavior predictability from previous days
- **Spectral Analysis**: Detect rhythmic patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal cycles)
- **Change Point Detection**: Identify when behavioral patterns shift significantly

### Animal Activity Pattern Research

**Key Concepts Applied to Sven:**
- **Actograms**: Standard chronobiology visualization showing activity over time
- **Activity Level Metrics**: Proportion of time spent active vs inactive
- **Circadian Rhythm Analysis**: Natural 24-hour behavioral cycles
- **Individual Variation**: Account for personal behavioral signatures
- **Environmental Coupling**: How external factors influence behavior patterns

**Research-Validated Tolerance Levels:**
- **Pattern Detection**: ±60 minutes for routine identification
- **Anomaly Detection**: ±30 minutes for outlier identification  
- **Seasonal Variation**: ±90 minutes for long-term trend analysis
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical approach using standard deviation from baseline

## Methodology Framework

### 1. Baseline Pattern Establishment

**Temporal Baselines:**
- **Weekday Patterns** (Monday-Friday): Account for human work schedules
- **Weekend Patterns** (Saturday-Sunday): Different human behavior may affect cat behavior
- **Seasonal Baselines**: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter behavioral norms
- **Holiday Patterns**: Special periods marked through annotation system

**Statistical Methods:**
- Calculate rolling 7-day averages for stability
- Use circular statistics for time-of-day analysis
- Apply mixed-effects models to account for day-type and season
- Establish confidence intervals (±1 standard deviation = normal behavior)

### 2. Activity Rhythm Analysis

**"Peak Sven Hours" Analysis:**
- Frequency histogram of exit/entry times across all data
- Identify primary and secondary activity peaks
- Seasonal overlay to show rhythm shifts
- Statistical significance testing for peak identification

**"Sven's Daily Rhythm" Analysis:**
- First exit time of each day (morning routine consistency)
- Last entry time of each day (evening routine consistency)
- Session clustering: quick trips vs long adventures vs overnight stays
- Transition pattern analysis: rapid cycles vs long gaps

### 3. Anomaly Detection

**Statistical Anomaly Thresholds:**
- **Mild Anomaly**: Outside ±1 standard deviation from baseline
- **Moderate Anomaly**: Outside ±2 standard deviations
- **Significant Anomaly**: Outside ±3 standard deviations
- **Pattern Disruption**: Sustained deviation lasting >3 days

**Anomaly Types:**
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Unusual exit/entry times
- **Duration Anomalies**: Unusually long or short outdoor sessions
- **Frequency Anomalies**: More/fewer sessions than typical
- **Routine Disruption**: Break in established patterns

### 4. Environmental Annotation System

**Annotation Categories:**
- **Health Events**: Injuries, vet visits, medication periods
- **Environmental Changes**: Weather extremes, construction, new animals
- **Human Schedule Changes**: Work from home, travel, guests
- **Seasonal Markers**: First snow, heat waves, garden changes

**Implementation:**
- JSON-based annotation storage with date ranges
- Color-coded visualization overlays
- Filter capability to include/exclude annotated periods
- Correlation analysis between annotations and behavior changes

## Visualization Standards

### Actogram Implementation

**Standard Actogram Features:**
- **X-axis**: 24-hour time periods (00:00 to 23:59)
- **Y-axis**: Days in chronological order (newest at top)
- **Activity Representation**: Bars/dots for exit and entry events
- **Double-plotting**: 48-hour display for overnight pattern visibility
- **Lighting Indicators**: Day/night background or top bar

**Enhanced Features for Sven:**
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for exits vs entries
- **Session Duration**: Bar thickness/opacity represents session length
- **Annotation Overlays**: Visual markers for special periods
- **Seasonal Boundaries**: Visual dividers for season changes

### Statistical Visualization

**Rhythm Analysis Plots:**
- **Activity Frequency Histograms**: Peak activity times
- **Consistency Scatter Plots**: Daily routine timing variation
- **Seasonal Comparison Plots**: Overlay different time periods
- **Confidence Interval Plots**: Show normal vs anomalous behavior ranges

**Interactive Features:**
- **Zoom/Pan**: Focus on specific time periods
- **Filter Controls**: Include/exclude weekends, seasons, annotations
- **Hover Details**: Show specific session information
- **Export Options**: High-resolution plots for analysis

## Data Quality Considerations

### Known Data Limitations

**Sunday Data Truncation:**
- SURE Petcare app downloads truncate Sunday afternoon data
- Statistical methods must account for systematic missing data
- Confidence levels adjusted for incomplete Sunday sessions
- Visual indicators for data quality issues

**Single Timestamp Confidence:**
- Rules 3b/4b provide mathematical precision but have tolerance ranges
- Confidence scoring based on rule application method
- Statistical weighting for high vs low confidence data points
- Separate analysis tracks for different confidence levels

### Quality Metrics

**Data Completeness Tracking:**
- Daily session count vs expected patterns
- Missing data period identification
- Confidence score distributions
- Processing report trend analysis

**Validation Methods:**
- Cross-validation with manually verified "golden" periods
- Consistency checks across different analysis methods
- Seasonal pattern stability verification
- Anomaly detection false positive rates
