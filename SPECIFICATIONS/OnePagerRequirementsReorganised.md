## 🎯 Project Vision

**Transform cat flap usage data into meaningful behavioral insights.** We're building a comprehensive analytics platform that liberates data trapped in weekly PDF reports and creates scientifically grounded visualizations of Sven's outdoor activity patterns, seasonal behaviors, and health indicators.

### Ultimate Goal
Enable deep understanding of pet behavioral patterns through:
- **Chronobiological analysis** - Natural activity rhythms and "Peak Sven Hours"
- **Seasonal pattern detection** - Understanding long-term behavioral changes
- **Health monitoring** - Early detection of behavioral anomalies
- **Contextual insights** - Correlating behavior with environmental events

### Target Audience
Magnus and Wendy - personal tool for understanding Sven's behavior patterns and well-being.

## 🔬 Phase 2: Scientific Behavioral Analytics - Implementation Plan

With V1.0 establishing a robust data foundation, Phase 2 focuses on scientifically rigorous behavioral analysis and visualization. Our approach is grounded in chronobiology research and animal behavior analysis standards.

### Phase 2.1: Foundation Analytics (Priority 1)
**Target User Stories:** US-013, US-014

**Step 1: Basic Actogram Implementation**
- Create chronobiological actogram visualization in web dashboard
- 24-hour X-axis with days on Y-axis, showing exit/entry events
- Activity frequency histogram for "Peak Sven Hours" analysis
- Configurable time windows (7-day, monthly views)
- *Estimated Duration: 2 weeks*

**Step 2: Daily Rhythm Pattern Analysis**
- Implement "Sven's Daily Rhythm" tracking (first exit, last entry)
- Statistical analysis with ±60 minute tolerance for routine detection
- Weekday vs weekend baseline pattern establishment
- Rolling 7-day pattern stability assessment using circular statistics
- *Estimated Duration: 1.5 weeks*

### Phase 2.2: Contextual Analytics (Priority 2)
**Target User Stories:** US-015, US-016

**Step 3: Behavioral Annotation System**
- JSON-based annotation storage for health/environmental events
- Simple web interface for adding date-range annotations
- Color-coded visualization overlays on all charts
- Filter capability to include/exclude annotated periods
- *Estimated Duration: 1 week*

**Step 4: Seasonal Pattern Detection**
- Implement seasonal baseline comparison (Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter)
- Statistical significance testing for seasonal differences
- Overlay visualization showing seasonal pattern shifts
- 4+ week period analysis per chronobiology research standards
- *Estimated Duration: 2 weeks*

### Phase 2.3: Advanced Health Monitoring (Priority 3)
**Target User Stories:** US-017, US-018

**Step 5: Anomaly Detection System**
- Statistical anomaly detection using ±2 standard deviation thresholds
- Classification of mild/moderate/significant anomalies
- Sustained pattern disruption alerts (>3 days deviation)
- Change point detection algorithm implementation
- *Estimated Duration: 2 weeks*

**Step 6: Data Quality Dashboard**
- Data completeness visualization and Sunday truncation impact assessment
- Single timestamp confidence scoring and reliability indicators
- Processing report trend analysis and validation metrics
- Quality-adjusted statistical analysis capabilities
- *Estimated Duration: 1 week*

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

**Phase 2.1 Success Criteria:**
- Actogram displays 500+ days of behavioral data accurately
- Peak activity hours identified with statistical confidence
- Daily routine consistency measured with ±60 minute tolerance
- User can identify Sven's behavioral patterns visually

**Phase 2.2 Success Criteria:**
- Annotation system allows correlation of behavior with real events
- Seasonal differences detected and displayed with statistical significance
- User can understand how Sven's behavior changes across seasons
- Historical context enhances pattern interpretation

**Phase 2.3 Success Criteria:**
- Anomaly detection identifies unusual behavioral periods accurately
- Health monitoring provides early warning indicators
- Data quality assessment guides interpretation confidence
- System provides actionable insights for pet care decisions

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- **Performance**: Pre-compute statistical analysis, implement progressive loading
- **Complexity**: Start with simple visualizations, add sophistication iteratively
- **Data Volume**: Efficient algorithms for 500+ days of session data

**User Experience Risks:**
- **Overwhelming Information**: Progressive disclosure, clear navigation hierarchy
- **Scientific Complexity**: Tooltips and help text explaining statistical concepts
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive design for all new analytics features

## 📋 Project Background

### The Problem
Pet owners cannot effectively analyze long-term cat flap usage patterns due to data being trapped in individual PDF files with no aggregation capabilities.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Weekly manual PDF downloads with data scattered across 50+ files
- No way to analyze trends over full date range
- Inability to identify seasonal or behavioral patterns
- Data stored in unusable format for analysis

### Our Solution
A comprehensive data processing and analytics platform that:
1. **Extracts** individual session data from SURE Petcare PDF reports
2. **Processes** data with mathematical precision (100% validation accuracy)
3. **Analyzes** behavioral patterns using chronobiology research standards
4. **Visualizes** insights through scientifically accurate dashboards

### Technology Foundation
- **Backend:** Python-based extraction engine with comprehensive testing
- **Frontend:** CloudFlare Workers web application with Material UI
- **Processing:** Automated GitHub Actions pipeline
- **Data:** Version-controlled datasets with automatic backups
