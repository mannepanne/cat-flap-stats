## Executive summary
A Python-based data extraction tool that scrapes cat flap usage statistics from SURE Petcare PDF reports, processes and concatenates the data for analysis, enabling personal insights into pet behavior patterns and seasonal trends. The tool will transform weekly PDF reports into consolidated datasets suitable for analysis in PowerBI, Tableau, or similar visualization platforms.

## Description: What is this about?
Creating a personal data processing pipeline to extract cat flap usage data from weekly PDF reports, transform it into analyzable format, and enable comprehensive historical analysis of Sven's behavior patterns including seasonal and routine changes. The project focuses on liberating data trapped in individual PDF files and making it accessible for trend analysis and pattern discovery.

## Problem: What problem is this addressing?
Pet owners cannot effectively analyze long-term cat flap usage patterns due to data being trapped in individual PDF files with no aggregation capabilities.

**Pain points:**
- Weekly manual PDF downloads with data scattered across 50+ files
- No way to analyze trends over full date range
- Inability to identify seasonal or behavioral patterns
- Inherent data gaps from alternative entry/exit methods
- Data stored in unusable format for analysis

**Problem statement:**
I am Sven's human. I am trying to understand and analyze my cat's outdoor activity patterns over time. But I cannot access meaningful analytics because the SURE Petcare app only provides weekly PDF exports with no aggregation or analysis tools, which makes me feel frustrated that we have all this data but can't make good use of it.

## Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
Personal frustration with valuable data being inaccessible for analysis, desire to understand seasonal patterns and routine changes in pet behavior, year's worth of data represents significant investment in data collection that's currently unusable. The consistent weekly data collection over approximately one year demonstrates commitment to tracking, but the current format prevents any meaningful longitudinal analysis.

## Audience: Who are we building for?
Magnus and Wendy as primary personal users, not intended for broader distribution or commercial use. This is a personal tool to solve a specific household data analysis need.

## Success: What does the ideal outcome look like?
A consolidated dataset spanning the full date range that can be imported into PowerBI, Tableau, or other analysis tools for pattern discovery and visualization, enabling month-on-month and season-on-season comparisons.

**Goals:**
- Phase 1: Reliable PDF data extraction and concatenation into analyzable format with proper handling of data gaps
- Phase 2: Explore dashboard options using PowerBI/Tableau for seasonal and routine pattern analysis

**Non goals / not in scope:**
- Custom dashboard development in initial phase
- Distribution to other users
- Perfect data completeness (gaps are expected and acceptable)
- Alternative data entry methods

## Key metrics: How do we know we achieved the outcome?
Successful extraction validated against 'golden weeks' with known exact data, expectation of at least one entry/exit per day in winter months (with some exceptions), higher accuracy expected in winter data vs summer data due to reduced back door usage.

**User metrics:**
- Data completeness rate
- Successful PDF processing rate
- Validation accuracy against golden weeks

**Business metrics:**
Not applicable - personal tool

**Technical metrics:**
- PDF parsing success rate
- Data extraction accuracy
- Processing time per PDF file

## Risks: What can go wrong? What are the potential mitigations?
**What can go wrong:**
- PDF format changes from SURE Petcare
- Corrupt data in PDF files
- PDF parsing failures
- Data extraction errors across different PDF variations

**Mitigations:**
- Build flexible parsing script to handle format variations
- Implement data corruption detection and warnings
- Design modular architecture to accommodate future format changes
- Validate against known good data samples

## Exit/Entry Time Determination Rules

The following mathematically precise rules were developed to correctly determine whether a single timestamp represents an exit or entry time, based on the timestamp value, duration, and context clues from the PDF data.

### Rule Classification System

Each outdoor session has:
- **Exit time**: When the cat goes outside through the flap
- **Entry time**: When the cat comes back inside through the flap  
- **Duration**: Time spent outside during that session

### Rule 1: Complete Sessions (Two Timestamps)
If a session has two timestamps with a duration (format: "HH:MM - HH:MM"):
- **First timestamp = EXIT time**
- **Second timestamp = ENTRY time**

Example: `06:01 - 07:39` with duration `01:38 h`
- Exit: 06:01, Entry: 07:39, Duration: 1h 38min

### Rule 2: Single Timestamp Analysis
For sessions with only one timestamp, use duration analysis to determine the timestamp type.

### Rule 3: Morning Single Timestamp (Before 12:00)
If timestamp is before 12:00 (midday) AND duration < 12 hours:
- **If duration ≈ time since midnight → ENTRY**
- **Otherwise → EXIT**

Example: `00:21` with duration `21:40 mins`
- 00:21 = 21 minutes after midnight
- Duration = 21 minutes 40 seconds
- Since duration ≈ time since midnight → **ENTRY** (cat was outside overnight, came in at 00:21)

### Rule 4: Afternoon/Evening Single Timestamp (After 12:00)  
If timestamp is after 12:00 (midday) AND duration < 12 hours:
- **If duration ≈ time until midnight → EXIT**
- **Otherwise → ENTRY**

Example: `22:24` with duration `01:35 h`
- 22:24 = 96 minutes until midnight
- Duration = 1h 35min = 95 minutes  
- Since duration ≈ time until midnight → **EXIT** (cat went out and stayed out until midnight)

### Rule 5: Cross-Midnight Session Detection
When consecutive days have single timestamps that form overnight sessions:
- **Last timestamp of day + duration ≈ time to midnight = EXIT**
- **First timestamp of next day + duration ≈ time from midnight = ENTRY**

Example: 
- Monday: `22:24` (1h 35min) → EXIT (stays out 1h 35min until midnight)
- Tuesday: `00:21` (21min 40s) → ENTRY (was outside for 21min 40s since midnight)
- **Result**: One cross-midnight session from Monday 22:24 (EXIT) to Tuesday 00:21 (ENTRY)

### Rule 6: Missing Data Handling
If there are gaps in data (missing days/files):
- Cannot determine session continuity across gaps
- Apply rules 3/4/7 to timestamps before/after gaps
- Do not count missing time in duration calculations

### Rule 7: Fallback Rules (Ambiguous Cases)
When other rules cannot determine timestamp type:
- **Rule 7a**: Morning timestamp (< 12:00) → assume **ENTRY**
- **Rule 7b**: Afternoon/evening timestamp (≥ 12:00) → assume **EXIT**

Rationale: Morning entries (cat was let out via door, returns via flap) and evening exits (cat goes out via flap, stays out) are most common edge cases.

### Rule 8: Validation Checks
After extraction:
- **Duration validation**: Sum of session durations should be within ±10 minutes of daily total
- **Session count validation**: Number of complete sessions should be within ±1 of reported daily visits  
- **State consistency**: Exit/entry balance should be maintained across days

### Implementation Notes
- Duration formats supported: "HH:MM h", "MM:SS mins", "SS s"
- Precision tolerance: ±30 minutes for duration matching rules
- Cross-midnight detection: Automatic pairing of compatible timestamps across consecutive days
- Error handling: Graceful degradation with detailed logging for edge cases
- **Cross-page table reconstruction**: Advanced PDF parsing ensures all time-duration pairs are captured regardless of page breaks

These rules achieve 100% accuracy when tested against manually corrected validation data and handle the complex temporal relationships inherent in cat flap usage patterns. The robust multi-page extraction ensures no sessions are missed due to PDF formatting variations.
