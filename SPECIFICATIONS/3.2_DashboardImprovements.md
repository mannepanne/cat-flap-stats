## üéØ Dashboard Vision

**Purpose:** Highlight data that indicates interesting recent changes, providing actionable insights that viewers can use to make decisions or take action. Move beyond "pretty pictures" to meaningful behavioral trend analysis.

**Core Philosophy:** Show how Sven's behavior changes over time and across seasons with focus on 21-day rolling windows that stay current as new data arrives.

## üìä Core Dashboard Elements (Priority Implementation)

### 1. Peak Sven Hours Trend Widget
**What:** Track "peak hour" over the past 21 days in a rolling window with directional trend indicator

**Implementation Details:**
- Calculate peak activity hour for each of the latest 21 days
- Show current peak hour prominently 
- Display trend arrow: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (getting later), ‚¨áÔ∏è (getting earlier), ‚û°Ô∏è (stable)
- Include magnitude of change (e.g., "30 minutes later than 3 weeks ago")
- Rolling window: when new data arrives, drop oldest 7 days and recalculate

**Data Source:** Existing peak hour calculation from `/patterns` page
**Calculation:** Daily activity frequency histograms ‚Üí identify peak hour per day ‚Üí trend analysis

### 2. Average Time Outside Trend Widget  
**What:** Track daily average time spent outside over latest 21 days with up/down trend

**Implementation Details:**
- Calculate total outdoor time per day for latest 21 days
- Show current 21-day average prominently
- Display trend indicator: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (increasing), ‚¨áÔ∏è (decreasing), ‚û°Ô∏è (stable)
- Include percentage change vs previous 21-day period
- Rolling window updates automatically with new data

**Data Source:** Session duration calculations from existing analytics
**Calculation:** Sum(session_durations) per day ‚Üí 21-day rolling average ‚Üí trend comparison

### 3. Daily Exits Trend Widget
**What:** Track number of exits per day over latest 21 days with trend indicator

**Implementation Details:**
- Count exits per day for latest 21 days (entries implied)
- Show current 21-day average prominently  
- Display trend indicator: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (more active), ‚¨áÔ∏è (less active), ‚û°Ô∏è (stable)
- Include average change in exits per day
- Rolling window updates automatically

**Data Source:** Exit events from session data
**Calculation:** Count(exits) per day ‚Üí 21-day rolling average ‚Üí trend analysis

### 4. 21-Day Timeline Chart
**What:** Visual timeline combining time outside per day and exits per day over latest 21 days

**Implementation Details:**
- Dual-axis line chart: 
  - Primary axis: Daily time outside (hours)
  - Secondary axis: Daily exits (count)
- X-axis: Last 21 days (date labels)
- Interactive tooltips showing exact values
- Color coding for weekdays vs weekends
- Trend lines for both metrics
- Responsive design for desktop analytics focus

**Visualization:** Chart.js or similar for interactive timeline
**Data Source:** Combined session duration and exit count calculations

## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Layer Enhancement
**Goal:** Extend existing analytics computations to support 21-day rolling windows

**Tasks:**
1. **Enhance `compute_analytics.py`** to calculate 21-day rolling metrics:
   - Daily peak hours for latest 21 days
   - Daily time outside totals for latest 21 days  
   - Daily exit counts for latest 21 days
   - Trend calculations (direction and magnitude)

2. **Update `master_dataset.json`** structure to include dashboard metrics:
   ```json
   "dashboard_metrics": {
     "peak_hours_21day": [...],
     "time_outside_21day": [...], 
     "exits_21day": [...],
     "trends": {
       "peak_hour_trend": "later|earlier|stable",
       "time_outside_trend": "up|down|stable",
       "exits_trend": "up|down|stable"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Rolling window logic:** Ensure calculations automatically use latest 21 days of available data

### Phase 2: Dashboard Backend Integration  
**Goal:** Serve dashboard metrics through existing CloudFlare Workers infrastructure

**Tasks:**
1. **Update `handleDashboard()` function** in `cloudflare-workers/index.js`:
   - Load dashboard metrics from master_dataset.json
   - Pass metrics to dashboard HTML template
   - Ensure efficient data loading (dashboard should be fast)

2. **Create dashboard API endpoint** (optional): `/api/dashboard-metrics` for future extensibility

### Phase 3: Dashboard Frontend Implementation
**Goal:** Replace current simple dashboard with rich behavioral insights interface

**Tasks:**
1. **Widget Layout Design:**
   - 3 metric widgets in top row (Peak Hours, Time Outside, Exits)
   - Timeline chart below spanning full width
   - Responsive grid layout with Material UI styling
   - Consistent with existing navigation sidebar

2. **Metric Widgets Implementation:**
   - Large primary value display
   - Trend arrow with color coding (green up, red down, gray stable)
   - Contextual subtitle with change magnitude
   - Clean, scannable design

3. **Timeline Chart Implementation:**
   - Interactive Chart.js dual-axis line chart
   - 21-day date range on X-axis
   - Tooltip interactions with exact values
   - Weekend highlighting or visual distinction
   - Responsive behavior for desktop focus

4. **Page Structure:**
   - Keep existing sidebar navigation
   - Page title: "Dashboard - Recent Behavioral Trends"
   - Brief explanatory text about 21-day rolling windows
   - Maintain fast load times

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
**Goal:** Ensure dashboard updates automatically with new PDF uploads

**Tasks:**
1. **Pipeline Integration:**
   - Verify `compute_analytics.py` runs automatically on new uploads
   - Test rolling window behavior with simulated data uploads
   - Confirm dashboard reflects new data immediately

2. **Performance Testing:**
   - Dashboard load time optimization
   - Chart rendering performance
   - Mobile compatibility verification

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Cross-check calculations against existing pages
   - Verify trend direction accuracy
   - Test edge cases (insufficient data, missing days)
